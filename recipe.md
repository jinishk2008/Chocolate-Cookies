Preheat oven to 350Â°F.

In a large bowl, cream the butter, sugar and brown sugar using a hand or standing mixer. This will take about 3-5 minutes. You want it to be nice and fluffy and you don't want to skimp on this step!

Add in cream cheese, vanilla and milk and mix to fully incorporate.

Whisk together flour, salt, baking powder and baking soda to combine. Slowly add the dry ingredients into the wet (I add about 1/3 of the mixture at a time) and mix to combine. Don't overmix, just mix to incorporate the ingredients.

Fold in the chocolate chips. Roll into 1 1/2 inch balls or scoop with a cookie scoop onto a baking sheet. Bake about 10-12 minutes and cookies just start to become light golden brown around the edges. Allow to cool for a few minutes before transferring to a cooling rack where you will have a hard time not shoveling one in before its cool enough to eat!
